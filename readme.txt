This patch is a revision of the algorithm used to generate rhythmical patterns as seen in the device Euclid. 

Current version supports up to 32 beats, across which up to 32 pulses can be equidistantly distributed. The pattern is computed through pattern.js, while circles_only_beats.js and lines.js generate a visual representation of the pattern.
